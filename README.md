# @me

Develop [@sliteteam](https://github.com/sliteteam) ([slite.com](https://slite.com)). My job is to ship features to users without setting our platform on fire. ~I also try to make our developer experience bearable.~ Stopped doing that, now learning engineering management.

This brings me to using buzz words such as: React, TypeScript, GraphQL, kubernetes, gitops.
