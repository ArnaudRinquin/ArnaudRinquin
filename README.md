Developer @gopigment

Some concepts I believe in:
* grow autonomy via strong ownership - team members lead their project, I am only here to support
* flexible role boundaries - broad understanding, skillset, interest is recipe for success and efficiency
* drastically reduce planing and metawork to what is vital - I'm no paper-pusher, I deliver value
* take shortcuts, not too much, know when to backtrack

My environment is the web, which brought me to grow skills in React, TypeScript, GraphQL, kubernetes, gitops and many other buzz words.
